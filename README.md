Personality test application


## Assignment
Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.


You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html


 * An example could be
 * Landing screen
 * Start personality test
 * Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just build CRUD, with in memory DB)
 * Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait.


It is a plus if you write some unit-tests.
